# BBC Micro:bit Examples

To be used with a Micro:bit V1 or V2 with a Grove adapter.

## Clap Light

Clap your hands to switch the Neopixels on P2 on and off. Uses a variable to store the current state of the lights.

## Distance Light

The ultrasonic sensor on P1 measures the distance up to 1m and lights up the Neopixels on P2 accordingly.

## Turn Light

As you turn the potentiometer on P1, the Neopixels on P2 change colour.

## Remote Control

Transmit A and B button presses over the radio to set Neopixels on P2 to red and green. Uses radio channel 0, but set your own channel if working in a group. You will need two Micro:bits, one powered by a battery to send the messages. Another with Neopixels on P2 to receive the messages.

## Grove Servo Buttons

Use the A and B buttons to set the single servo on P1 to 0 or 180 degrees. *Note that this needs a powered Grove adapter, such as from Seeed Studio, to get sufficient voltage to operate the servo.* When you have programmed the Micro:bitmove the USB cable to the board.
